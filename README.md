# This is simple test repository for automated testing.

This repository is used for automated testing as described in the [CodeRefinery Testing Lecture](https://coderefinery.github.io/testing/continuous-integration/).

Simply [fork](https://github.com/AaltoRSE/PyTestingExample/fork) it to your own github repositories, make a local clone
```
git clone https://github.com/<yourGitHubName>/PyTestingExample
```
and then follow the remaining [Steps 2.-11. in the exercise instructions](https://coderefinery.github.io/testing/continuous-integration/#step-2-run-tests-locally).

The "Solution" branch contains a version with all tests corrected and set up along with a template for the github action necessary. You can include it into your fork by unticking the box "Copy the `main` branch only" but this is not mandatory.
